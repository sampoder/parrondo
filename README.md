This is a simple simulation of [Parrondo's Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parrondo%27s_paradox) written in Ruby. 
It was written as coursework for [Berkeley's Math 24 seminar in Spring 2024](https://classes.berkeley.edu/content/2024-spring-math-24-001-sem-001) 
(Classical and Quantum Walks w/ Prof. Grunbaum).

Here's my notes from the lesson (apolgies for the scruffiness!):
